			<p ><center><h4>In  meteorology,</h4></center> a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute <mark>liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles</mark> suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body. Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture <i>usually in the form of water vapor</i> from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature. They are seen in the Earth's homosphere <em>(which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere).</em>
			<strong> Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken  in the cloud physics branch of meteorology. </strong></p>

				<em><strong>What Causes Rain?</strong>
				<br>
				Most of the water in clouds is in very small droplets. The droplets are so light they float in the air. Sometimes those droplets join with other droplets. Then they turn into larger drops. When that happens, gravity causes them to fall to Earth. We call the falling water drops "rain." When the air is colder, the water may form snowflakes instead. Freezing rain, sleet or even hail can fall from clouds.</blockquote><em>

				<strong>What Are Some Types of Clouds?</strong><br>

					<i>Clouds get their names in two ways. One way is by where they are found in the sky. Some clouds are high up in the sky. Low clouds form closer to Earth's surface. In fact, low clouds can even touch the ground. These clouds are called fog. Middle clouds are found between low and high clouds.Another way clouds are named is by their shape. Cirrus clouds are high clouds. They look like feathers. Cumulus clouds are middle clouds. These clouds look like giant cotton balls in the sky. Stratus clouds are low clouds. They cover the sky like bed sheets.</i>
